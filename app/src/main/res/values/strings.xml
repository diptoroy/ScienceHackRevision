The publication of Newton discoveries led to controversies involving English natural philosopher Robert Hooke, Anthony Lucas, mathematical professor at Liege; Francis Line, a physician in , and many others. English astronomer and mathematician Edmond Halley attempted to mediate and get Newton to agree that Hooke deserved some credit for the invention of "the rule for the decrease of gravity being reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the centre"</string>
    <string name="scientist_details">Details : Sir Isaac Newton PRS (25 December 1642 â€“ 20 March 1726/27[a]) was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author (described in his own day as a "natural philosopher") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time, and a key figure in the scientific revolution. His book Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus.</string>
